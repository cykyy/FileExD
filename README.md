A simple Java recursive file downloader from directory listing sites!
Download files/folders recursively from file index/directory listing sites. FilExD will create folders/files based on remote target site structure and download files from the target site to your specified local location. You won't find any difference in folder structure and file name after it completes the job.
Currently supported H5ai and Nginx Fancyindex based sites. The tool can be upgraded to support more platforms.

## Build
The project is based on IntelliJ IDEA and used Java 11. Clone the project and build.
If you want to run the tool from a terminal/command line, go to src folder from the terminal (eg: cd /ParentFolder/FileExD/src) and type "javac Start.java" and then type "java Start" to run.
