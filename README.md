# FileExD
Welcome to FilExD!
Download files/folders recursively from file index listing sites. FilExD will create folders/files based on remote target site structure and download files from the target site to your specified local location. You won't find any difference in folder structure and file name after it completes the job.
Currently supported H5ai and Nginx Fancyindex based sites. The tool is can be upgraded to support more scripts.
